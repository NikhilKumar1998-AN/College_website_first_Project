# College_website_first_Project
I made a website for my college project. This website is based in the EV. 
My aim is to create a problem solving and user-friendly website to raise awareness about electric vehicles and their benefits for both people and the environment. Our website will provide service to all types of EV users across metropolitan cities and small towns. Our platform will also help them to know disposable and handling process of electric vehicle.  We will provide advantages of EVs, spreading their safety, environment-friendliness, and contribution to a zero-carbon future.
